This is an implementation of a trading card game battle system in Typescript written on the [@cards-ts framework](https://github.com/johnameyer/cards-ts). It contains no actual game data and is intended for research purposes around gameplay strategization.

Developed mainly though generative AI so even with test coverage there is a chance of bugs.

## Features

### Core Battle System
- ✅ Card battles with HP and damage tracking
- ✅ Active card and bench management (max 3 benched cards)
- ✅ Card evolution system (Basic → Stage 1 → Stage 2)
- ✅ Attack system with damage calculation
- ✅ Knockout detection and handling
- ✅ Points-based winning system (3 points to win)
- ✅ Turn-based gameplay with state machine architecture

### Card Management
- ✅ Evolution chains (multiple evolution stages)
- ✅ Card promotion from bench to active
- ✅ Evolution restrictions (once per turn, not on first turn)
- ✅ Individual card instance tracking for evolution logic

### Game Flow
- ✅ Game setup with active card selection
- ✅ Turn structure with Draw, Main, Attack, and Checkup phases
- ✅ Hand and deck management
- ✅ Bot opponents for single-player games
- ✅ Turn counter and state tracking
- ✅ Customizable game parameters (hand size, turn limits)

### Energy System
- ✅ Energy Zone with automatic generation
- ✅ Energy attachment mechanics
- ✅ Energy-based attack requirements
- ✅ Multi-type Energy generation
- ✅ Energy accelerator effects

### Special Conditions
- ✅ Asleep, Burned, Confused, Paralyzed, Poisoned
- ✅ Special condition interactions and removal
- ✅ Status effect damage between turns

### Advanced Mechanics
- ✅ Tool attachment system
- ✅ Card abilities (passive effects)
- ✅ Retreating with Energy costs
- ✅ Weakness (+20 damage) system
- ✅ First turn restrictions
- ✅ Turn limits (default 30 turns, customizable)
- ✅ Hand size limits (default 10 cards, customizable)
- ✅ Stadium cards with persistent field effects

### Battle Features
- ✅ Special ex cards (2 points when knocked out)
- ✅ Mega ex cards (3 points when knocked out)
- ✅ Ex protection effects (prevent damage from ex/mega ex cards)
- ✅ Coin flip mechanics for attacks/effects
- ✅ Special condition checkup phase

## Running

After building, start the game:

```bash
node dist/start.js
```

The game supports customizable parameters via command line arguments. Use `--help` to see all available options:

```bash
node dist/start.js --help
```

## Using Custom Card Definitions

This package exports all card type definitions, allowing you to create your own card repositories with custom creatures, supporters, items, tools, and stadiums.

### Example Usage

```typescript
import { 
  CardRepository, 
  CreatureData, 
  SupporterData, 
  ItemData, 
  ToolData,
  StadiumData 
} from '@cards-ts/pocket-tcg';

// Define your custom creatures
const myCreatures = new Map<string, CreatureData>();
myCreatures.set('my-creature', {
  templateId: 'my-creature',
  name: 'My Creature',
  maxHp: 100,
  type: 'fire',
  weakness: 'water',
  retreatCost: 1,
  attacks: [
    { 
      name: 'Fireball', 
      damage: 30, 
      energyRequirements: [{ type: 'fire', amount: 2 }] 
    }
  ]
});

// Define your custom supporters
const mySupporters = new Map<string, SupporterData>();
mySupporters.set('my-supporter', {
  templateId: 'my-supporter',
  name: 'My Supporter',
  effects: [
    { 
      type: 'draw', 
      amount: { type: 'constant', value: 3 } 
    }
  ]
});

// Create a card repository with your custom cards
const cardRepository = new CardRepository(
  myCreatures,
  mySupporters,
  new Map<string, ItemData>(),
  new Map<string, ToolData>()
);

// Use the repository with the game factory
// (see game-factory.ts for more details)
```

### Exported Types

The package exports all necessary types for card definitions:

- **Card Types**: `CreatureData`, `SupporterData`, `ItemData`, `ToolData`, `StadiumData`
- **Effect Types**: `Effect`, `HpEffect`, `StatusEffect`, `DrawEffect`, `EnergyEffect`, and more
- **Target Types**: `Target`, `FixedTarget`, `SingleChoiceTarget`, `MultiChoiceTarget`, `AllMatchingTarget`
- **Condition Types**: `Condition` for conditional effects
- **Energy Types**: `AttachableEnergyType`, `EnergyRequirementType`
- **Effect Values**: `EffectValue`, `ConstantValue`, `ResolvedValue`, `ConditionalValue`, and more
- **Repository**: `CardRepository` class for managing card data

### Stadium Cards

Stadium cards are a special trainer card type that provide persistent field-wide effects:

- Only one stadium can be active at a time
- Playing a new stadium replaces the current one (discarded to owner's pile)
- Cannot play a stadium with the same name as the active stadium
- Only one stadium can be played per turn (similar to supporters)
- Stadium effects persist until replaced or removed
- Support for passive effects like HP bonuses, damage modifiers, retreat cost changes, etc.

## Development

### Building

```bash
pnpm run build
```

### Testing

```bash
# Run all tests
pnpm test

# Run specific tests
pnpm test -- --grep 'Target'
```
