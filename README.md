This is an implementation of the battle mechanisms of Pokemon Pocket TCG in Typescript written on the [@cards-ts framework](https://github.com/johnameyer/cards-ts). It contains no actual game data and is intended for research purposes around gameplay strategization.

Developed mainly though generative AI so even with test coverage there is a chance of bugs.
